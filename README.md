# AWS EC2 instance type pricing comparison

**Use here ðŸ‘‰ [ec2instances.github.io](https://ec2instances.github.io)**

Built with:

1. EC2 pricing data from AWS (the same source their pricing page pulls it from).
2. [Tabulator](http://tabulator.info/) to convert the JSON data to a sortable table.
3. [corsproxy.io](https://corsproxy.io/) - a CORS proxy
4. [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) - minimalistic CSS framework (think Tailwind CSS, but based on CSS variables)

## Why build this?

Remember `https://ec2instances.info/` (now available at `https://instances.vantage.sh/`) ? Used to be a great website, but it has some unfixed bugs, lags updates etc.

I got tired of waiting for bugs to be fixed and created this.

### Contributions welcome
