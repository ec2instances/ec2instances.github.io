# AWS EC2 instance type pricing comparison

**Use here ðŸ‘‰ [ec2instances.github.io](https://ec2instances.github.io)**

1. It pulls up to date EC2 pricing data from AWS (the same source their pricing page pulls it).
2. It uses [Tabulator](http://tabulator.info/) to convert the JSON data to a sortable table.
3. Kudos to https://allorigins.win/ for providing a CORS proxy.

## Why build this?

Remember `https://ec2instances.info/` (now available at `https://instances.vantage.sh/`) ? Used to be a gret website, but it hasn't been updated for a long time and some pricing info is simply missing (chekc the "t3a" price, it just says "unavailable")

I got sick and tired of waiting for bugs to be fixed and created this.
